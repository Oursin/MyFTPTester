# MyFTP Tester

This project is a tester to use on the MyFTP Epitech Project.

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute to the project, feel free to add a new test file (named test##.py, with ## being a number greater than the current highest test).

To create a test, you must create a "test" function in your file, which takes a socket.socket as it's fisrt argument and the socket timeout as it's second argument.

The socket is the master connection, though which you may send your FTP commands. Feel free to take a look at the current tests to see how it all works.
